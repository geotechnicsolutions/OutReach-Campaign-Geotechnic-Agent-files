## Geotechnic Solutions

**Scope:** Strategy, tone, positioning, structure, and governance rules.
**Audience:** AI agents operating in research, drafting, and analysis roles.

---

## 1. Strategic Objective

Geotechnic Solutions positions itself as a **technical intelligence partner** in geothermal and renewable energy development, supporting:

* early-stage screening
* investment de-risking
* policy-aligned regional analysis

The goal of outreach is **not selling services**, but:

* initiating high-quality, credibility-based conversations
* offering value before commitment
* qualifying serious counterparties

---

## 2. Core Positioning

Geotechnic Solutions is positioned as:

> *An independent, technically rigorous partner helping investors, developers, and public agencies make better early-stage decisions in geothermal and renewable energy projects.*

### Key principles

* Evidence-driven, not hype-driven
* Technical depth, not generic consulting
* Neutral analysis, not sales pressure
* Early-stage intelligence, not execution promises

---

## 3. Locked Segments & Offers

These mappings are **immutable** and must never be altered by agents.

**Typical roles:**
VC Partner, Investment Manager, Infrastructure Fund, Energy Transition Investor

---

## 4. Outreach Philosophy

Outreach must always:

* Lead with relevance, not credentials
* Reference a concrete trigger (market, policy, geography, project type)
* Offer value without obligation
* Invite dialogue, not pitch services

Outreach must **never**:

* sound promotional or sales-driven
* exaggerate certainty
* promise outcomes
* pressure for meetings

---

## 5. Message Structure (MANDATORY)

All first-touch outreach drafts must follow this structure:

1. **Personalized hook**

   * Why this person, why now
   * One clear contextual reference

2. **Value framing**

   * What Geotechnic Solutions helps clarify or de-risk
   * No claims of execution or guarantees

3. **Offer articulation**

   * Reference the correct locked offer only
   * Frame as exploratory, optional, and free

4. **Soft CTA**

   * Invite a short exchange or interest
   * No scheduling links, no urgency language

---

## 6. Channel Rules

* **Choose ONE channel only** on first contact
  (LinkedIn OR Email — never both)

* Channel choice should follow:

  * availability of verified email
  * seniority and typical communication norms

---

## 7. Follow-Up Logic (Advisory Only)

Agents may **propose** follow-up timing but must never schedule or send follow-ups.

### Recommended cadence

* **FU1:** +5–7 business days
* **FU2:** +10–14 business days

Follow-ups must always introduce **new value or context**, never “check-ins”.

---

## 8. Data & Assumption Discipline

Agents must:

* Use only data present in the authoritative outreach queue
* Skip leads with missing or ambiguous data
* Never infer intent, interest, or seniority
* Never invent personas, segments, or offers

If required data is missing → **skip and flag**

---

## 9. Hard Governance Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

AI agents must never:

* Send messages
* Post on LinkedIn
* Email anyone
* Update contact status to “Contacted”
* Trigger reminders or automations
* Modify spreadsheets directly
* Invent facts, urgency, or personalization details
* Multi-channel on Day 1

If any source document is inaccessible → **STOP and report the failing URL**

---

## 10. Success Criteria

A successful run produces:

* High-quality, personalized drafts
* Correct segment and offer alignment
* Clean, copy-paste-ready outputs for human review
* No unauthorized actions or assumptions
